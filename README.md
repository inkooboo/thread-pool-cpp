 * It is highly scalable and fast.
 * It is header only.
 * No external dependencies, only standard library needed.
 * It implements both work-stealing and work-distribution balancing startegies.
 * It implements cooperative scheduling strategy.

Advantages of c++:
1.Portability
2.Object oriented
3.Multi paradigm
4.Low level manipulation
5.Memory management
Example run:
Post job to thread pool is much faster than for boost::asio based thread pool.
